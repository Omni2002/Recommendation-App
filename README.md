Project for Chronicle Hackathon:

The app is a prototype for a recommendation system that gives both an average rating based on all the reviews in a database, but also gives a personalised weighted rating of 
products and services based on an individual user's priorities. For the prototype, we focused on comparison of hotels to demonstrate how the system would function very basically
by assigning the attributes of location, hospitality, cleaniness, amenities, and ease of booking to gauge which of these attributes were more important to the user based on 
their reviews and surveys.
